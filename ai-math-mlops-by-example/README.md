# AI Math & MLOps by Example

This repository provides hands-on notebooks and book chapters that explore foundational mathematics for machine learning along with practical MLOps implementations. Each module focuses on one algorithm, pairing explanations with runnable code.

## Project Goals

- **Learn by implementing** essential algorithms in Python.
- **Build intuition** for linear algebra, calculus, and probability/statistics.
- **Document** the journey in a publishable book and LinkedIn series.

Contributions are welcome as we expand the series to cover 25 algorithms.

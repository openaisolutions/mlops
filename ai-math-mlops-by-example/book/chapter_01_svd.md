# Singular Value Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a core tool in linear algebra. It expresses any matrix $A$ as the product $U \Sigma V^T$, revealing orthogonal directions and how the matrix stretches space. In machine learning, SVD underlies algorithms for dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, and more.

## Why It Matters in AI

SVD provides a way to uncover latent structure in data, compress information, and stabilize numerical computations. From image compression to natural language processing, its applications are broad and deep.
